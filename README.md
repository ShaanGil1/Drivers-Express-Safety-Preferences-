## Drivers-Express-Safety-Preferences

# Summary of Project
In the current pandemic climate, essential workers such as food delivery drivers have become increasingly vital to daily living. While food delivery companies have taken measures to protect the customers (such as creating a no-contact option), these options aren’t available to the drivers making them vulnerable to a multitude of situations. These situations include customers without masks and choosing to opt for the contact options as well as delivering to high-contact environments. In addition, from research conducted, it was found that drivers felt most vulnerable when picking up food rather than delivering it. This is due to when restaurants and its patrons don’t follow safety precautions such as wearing masks and/or social distancing and the drivers have to walk through the restaurants to pick up the order. With this prototype we specifically tackle the customer-driver interaction in an attempt to promote driver safety when delivering.
